# Picard All MBIDs

This is a plugin for Picard designed to add MBIDs for all other roles where possible (remixer, composer, label).
It tries to use the same naming convention as the original tags.

Note: for performers/instruments, each performer/instrument type is a **separate** tag.

Tested with 2.12.3, flac/m4a/mp3. Your mileage may vary.
